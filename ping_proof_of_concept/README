Server:
  sudo tcpdump icmp -i any -A -w captures
Client:
  Compile encode.c
  gcc encode.c
  ./a.out script| awk '{printf("ping -c1 -p %s 10.0.2.15\n",$1)}'| bash
Server:
  Control-C (want to get rid of in the furure because it destroys most utility)
  parse captures file *work in progress
    you can cat captures to view the message in the pcap binary
    "tcpdump -A -r captures" is the proper way to do it but I do not know how to parse it
  pipe the parsed (and concatanated) string into a shell (like bash)
